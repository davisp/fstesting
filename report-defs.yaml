  # Filesystem Compatibility Test Report

  This report contains the results of running a series of tests against a
  local filesystem. This is intended to give a high level overview of the
  filesystem's ability to handle a number of common filesystem operations.

  Tests are grouped by topic. The table below lists results by topic. The
  sections that follow show a break down by individual test along with
  a short description of what each test is covering.
topics:
  cprange: "Copy file ranges via `copy_file_range`"
  dirs: "Directory operations"
  fadvise: "Controlling page cache behavior with `fadvise`"
  falloc: "Allocate file space via `fallocate`"
  fcntl: "Check various operations via `fcntl`"
  flock: "File locking operations via `flock`"
  fsync: "Flushing data to disk via `fsync`"
  mdata: "Operations on file metadata like `chmod` and `utime`"
  open: "Test the behavior of `O_CREAT | O_EXCL`"
  open_creat: "Check the behavior of `open` with `O_CREAT`"
  open_exist_ro: "Check `open` with an existing read-only file"
  open_exist_rw: "Check `open` with an existing readable and writeable file"
  open_ne: "Check `open` with a filename that doesn't exist"
  pread: "Test the behavior of `pread`"
  pwrite: "Test the behavior of `pwrite`"
  read: "Test the behavior of `read`"
  seek: "Test the behavior of `lseek`"
  statfs: "Check support for `statfs`"
  symlink: "Test support for `symlink`"
  truncate: "Test the behavior of `truncate`"
